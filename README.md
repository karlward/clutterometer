clutterometer
=============

Clutterometer was authored by Andrew Cerrito, Jon Wasserman, and Karl Ward, 
incorporating code and ideas from several existing projects (listed in 
CREDITS). 

Clutterometer attempts to guage the amount of clutter present in a kitchen 
sink, using various sensors (video camera, force sensing floor mat) and 
actuators (servo, speaker).  It was created as a midterm project for Tom 
Igoe's class Introduction to Physical Computing in Fall 2012.
