clutterometer
=============
Clutterometer attempts to guage the amount of clutter present in a kitchen 
sink, using various sensors (video camera, force sensing floor mat) and 
actuators (servo, speaker).  It was created for our "Conscientious Sink" 
midterm project for Tom Igoe's class Introduction to Physical Computing in 
Fall 2012. 

Clutterometer was authored by Andrew Cerrito, Jon Wasserman, and Karl Ward, 
incorporating code and ideas from several existing projects (listed in 
CREDITS).
